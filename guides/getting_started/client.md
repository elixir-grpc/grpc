# Client

This section demonstrates how to establish client connections and perform RPC calls using the Elixir gRPC client.

---

## Basic Connection and RPC

Typically, you start this client supervisor as part of your application's supervision tree:

```elixir
children = [
  {GRPC.Client.Supervisor, []}
]

opts = [strategy: :one_for_one, name: MyApp.Supervisor]
Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)
``` 

You can also start it manually in scripts or test environments:
```elixir
{:ok, _pid} = GRPC.Client.Supervisor.start_link()
``` 

Then connect with gRPC server:

```elixir
iex> {:ok, channel} = GRPC.Stub.connect("localhost:50051")
iex> request = Helloworld.HelloRequest.new(name: "grpc-elixir")
iex> {:ok, reply} = channel |> Helloworld.GreetingServer.Stub.say_unary_hello(request)
```

---

## Using Interceptors

Client interceptors allow you to add logic to the request/response lifecycle, such as logging, tracing, or authentication.

```elixir
iex> {:ok, channel} =
...>   GRPC.Stub.connect("localhost:50051",
...>     interceptors: [GRPC.Client.Interceptors.Logger]
...>   )
iex> request = Helloworld.HelloRequest.new(name: "Alice")
iex> {:ok, reply} = channel |> Helloworld.GreetingServer.Stub.say_unary_hello(request)
```

---

## Compression and Metadata

You can specify message compression and attach default headers to all requests.

```elixir
iex> {:ok, channel} =
...>   GRPC.Stub.connect("localhost:50051",
...>     compressor: GRPC.Compressor.Gzip,
...>     headers: [{"authorization", "Bearer my-token"}]
...>   )
```

---

## Client Adapters

By default, `GRPC.Stub.connect/2` uses the **Gun** adapter.  
You can switch to **Mint** (pure Elixir HTTP/2) or other adapters as needed.

### Using Mint Adapter

```elixir
iex> GRPC.Stub.connect("localhost:50051",
...>   adapter: GRPC.Client.Adapters.Mint
...> )
```

You can configure adapter options globally via your application’s config:

```elixir
# File: config/config.exs
config :grpc, GRPC.Client.Adapters.Mint,
  timeout: 10_000,
  transport_opts: [cacertfile: "/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt"]
```

The accepted options are the same as [`Mint.HTTP.connect/4`](https://hexdocs.pm/mint/Mint.HTTP.html#connect/4-options).
